Hello! I'm David McKenna, a software engineer based in the SF Bay Area. This is my personal site where I write about things I find interesting.

You can send me an email at <dm@davidmck.com>, and find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-mckenna/) and [Github](https://github.com/davemckenna).

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), using the [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) theme.
