Hello! I'm David McKenna, a software engineer based in the SF Bay Area. This is my personal site where I write about things I find interesting.

Feel free to send me an [email](mailto:dm@davidmck.com) at dm@davidmck.com. You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-mckenna).

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), using the [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) theme.
